My DnD wiki!!

My goal is to create a wiki of my world that is interactable, and stores all the informaiton as needed- at the end of the day, it should interact like a normal wiki

But, as a computer scientist, this wiki is also for me to learn and have a personal project that I can show off on my resume

Some cool things I'm working on:
-This should be a full stack website - using mongo for the DB, express, and node
    -I want to make it super optimized, hsould use all the tips and tricks I can
-Have a 3d interactable world map (currently tried a proof of concept with threeJS, I need to get back on blender tho)
-Have interactions between the different character pages
-Have some cool data analysis where we can visualize how different parts of the world are connected

Some things I want later on:
-A world time line
    -Have a way to have seperate timelines for each campaign
    -Have 3d models of npcs
