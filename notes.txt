Currently things to implement:
-Fixing data formatting
    -Correcting how the world, character, and lore information is stored
-Make a change log for file
    -Keep track of changes - like a git file

    How to implement this???
    ->So you have a function that takes in the file that it has stored - a base file
        -it traverses the json file object by object
        -compares it has it in its json file
            records the log as such
    ->then it compares the your file, and the file you have stored
    ->then it saves the changes in a secondary change log

-implement parsing 
    -tags
    -go into information and then check to change things into a tag
        this should happen so that when i update the lore, i dont need to manually add tags

data visualization

basically takes the data framework and makes a dictionary - each item should have a subdictionary
    it should store what other components mention it
    could be a directional graph

    Maybe just npcs?

    ex: Illmindel: {"Place of Birth": "Isortar"}

    then: 
        Dict: {"isortar": {"Illmindel" = {1}}}

    No, I think you save where you point towards, 
        {
            "Illmindel" = { "Isortar" = 1}}
        }

compare function: 
    needs to be recursive
    should have a parent function that calls the compare function
parent compare: 
    initializes a new json object
    compare function should write into this object
